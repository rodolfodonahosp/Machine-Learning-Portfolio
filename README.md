# Machine-Learning-Portfolio

Repository cointaining some of my Machine Learning projects for self learning, hobby and showcasing purposes. All the projects are presented using Jupyter Notebook and written in Python.

## Contents
  - [German Traffic Signs Classification using CNN's](https://github.com/rodolfodonahosp/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Traffic_Signs.ipynb): Used a standard CNN to classificate german traffic signs. Also used proprocessing techniques, data visualization tools and image generator for a better accuracy
 
  - [MNIST Classification + layer visualization](https://github.com/rodolfodonahosp/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Convolutional_Neural_Networks_MNIST.ipynb): Simple MNIST dataset classification and data visualization tools. Used the Model class from keras to generate activation insights from data traversing from layer to layer
 
  - [Polynomial Regression using neural networks](https://github.com/rodolfodonahosp/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Polynomial_Regression.ipynb): Using neural networks to solve a regression problem using randomly generated date points scattered in a 2D environment.
